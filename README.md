# Fleet Operations Cost Efficiency (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
BST Trucking management aims to build an interactive dashboard to analyze six months of route and fuel data, targeting high-cost lanes and underperforming drivers. The goal is to identify operational changes for potential annual savings of $120,000.
## Dataset Used

## Questions (KPIs)
-	What is the cost per mile for our fleet operations?
-	How efficient are our vehicles in terms of miles per gallon (MPG)?
-	What is the overall cost per trip?
-	How does each driver perform based on average cost per trip?
-	Which routes show the highest costs, lowest MPG, and longest average times?
-	How does total fuel cost vary by month?
-	What is our on-time delivery rate as a percentage?

 ## The Process
-	Checked for missing values and anomalies.
-	Ensuring data consistency and cleanliness in type, format, and values. 
-	Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
-	All pivot tables were combined into one dashboard, with a slicer included to enable dynamic interaction.
