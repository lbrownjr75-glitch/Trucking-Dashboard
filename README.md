# Fleet Operations Cost Efficiency (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
BST Trucking management aims to build an interactive dashboard to analyze six months of route and fuel data, targeting high-cost lanes and underperforming drivers. The goal is to identify operational changes for potential annual savings of $120,000.
## Dataset Used
-<a href="https://github.com/lbrownjr75-glitch/Trucking-Dashboard/blob/main/Trucking_Fleet_Operations_Report.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
-	What is the cost per mile for our fleet operations?
-	How efficient are our vehicles in terms of miles per gallon (MPG)?
-	What is the overall cost per trip?
-	How does each driver perform based on average cost per trip?
-	Which routes show the highest costs, lowest MPG, and longest average times?
-	How does total fuel cost vary by month?
-	What is our on-time delivery rate as a percentage?
- Interactive Dashboard <a href="https://github.com/lbrownjr75-glitch/Trucking-Dashboard/blob/main/BST%20Trucking%20Fleet%20Operations.xlsx">View Dashboard</a>
 ## The Process
-	Checked for missing values and anomalies.
-	Ensuring data consistency and cleanliness in type, format, and values. 
-	Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
-	All pivot tables were combined into one dashboard, with a slicer included to enable dynamic interaction.

## Project Insight 
-	Which drivers have highest cost per trip?
-	Which routes are least fuel efficient?
-	Where is the most money being spent?
-	Which months had delivery delays or spikes in cost?
## Executive Summary
Key Insights and Recommendations from Operational Analysis
Our recent operational review has highlighted several critical areas impacting cost and efficiency within our transportation network. Through detailed analysis of driver performance, route metrics, fuel expenditures, and delivery punctuality, we have identified clear opportunities for improvement and significant potential savings.
- High-Cost Routes: Three routes consistently contribute to the highest operational expenses, primarily due to lower fuel efficiency and higher average costs per trip.
-	Driver Performance: Two drivers have been identified as consistently underperforming in terms of cost per trip, indicating the need for targeted retraining or support.
-	Fuel Optimization: Refueling patterns show inefficiencies, presenting an opportunity to optimize stops and reduce total fuel costs.
-	Financial Impact: By addressing these findings through route adjustments and focused driver development, we project an estimated annual savings of $120,000.

Moving forward, we recommend implementing strategic route changes and enhanced driver training programs to capitalize on these insights, improving both cost control and service reliability. These actions will not only reduce expenses but also strengthen our commitment to operational excellence and on-time delivery.
