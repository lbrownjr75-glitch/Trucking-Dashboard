# Fleet Operations Cost Efficiency (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
BST Trucking management aims to build an interactive dashboard to analyze six months of route and fuel data, targeting high-cost lanes and underperforming drivers. The goal is to identify operational changes for potential annual savings of $120,000.
## Dataset Used

## Questions (KPIs)
•	What is the cost per mile for our fleet operations?
•	How efficient are our vehicles in terms of miles per gallon (MPG)?
•	What is the overall cost per trip?
•	How does each driver perform based on average cost per trip?
•	Which routes show the highest costs, lowest MPG, and longest average times?
•	How does total fuel cost vary by month?
•	What is our on-time delivery rate as a percentage?
